##### Chicken Biriyani
>It’s a **whole meal**  in it self, has fragrance, aromatics, spices and either vegetables or different meats accompanied with gravy or raita made of yogurt/ curd served with cucumber etc. You don’t need any other vegetables or meats it’s one dish with all ingredients for a full meal. **The taste and flavour of well cooked Biryani is amazing**, however the ingredients play a major role and then there are variations from state to state and even within the community.
